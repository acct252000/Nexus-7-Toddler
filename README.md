# Nexus-7-Toddlerize
Android app that mimics tablet for a toddler (1.5 to 3 years).

This app was designed to be installed on an 2012 Nexus 7 Wifi tablet that was rooted.  The original app disabled then navigation bar on launch and would be exited by pressing the exit button 11 times consecutively.
Due to numerous problems in coding this functionality that at times rendered said table unusable, I have removed this code from the public version as it will differ from tablet to tablet and Android version.  You may re-enter this code at your own risk.




## How to Use

Clone this app into your local directory and open in Android Studio.  Run on your connected device.
